    <p>
        The <i>Vanir</i> were one of the two primary tribes of deities in Pre-Christian Norse mythology.
        The Vanir consisted of the minor Norse gods who resided in Vanaheim (one of the nine worlds within the branches of 
        the world-tree, Yggdrasil) and possessed connections to the earthly plane. The Vanir included Freya, Freyr, and Njord.
