    <h1>The Aesir</h1>
    <p>
        The <i>Aesir</i> were one of the two primary tribes of deities in Pre-Christian Norse mythology.
        The Aesir included the greater of the Norse gods who resided in Asgard (one of the nine worlds within the branches of 
        the world-tree, Yggdrasil) and possessed connections to the celestial plane. 
        The Aesir included Odin, Thor, Frigg, Tyr, Loki, Baldur, Heimdall, Idun, and Bragi.
